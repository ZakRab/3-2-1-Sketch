# 3-2-1 Sketch!
This game was built with React, Node, Express, and Socket io.
Inspired by the hit board game "how do you doodle" I built this game to play with family after our game was tragically lost to my cousins in Kansas City.
## how to play

each round the players are given a card with three items. Each Player is given one of the three items to draw and is given 45 seconds to draw it. After the time runs out the other players vote on what of the three items you drew. 

### scoring

Points are scored by correctly guessing others votes and having other players correctly guess what you drew. Points are also lost if you incorrectly guess anothers players drawing. Voting on a player's sketch is not mandatory so in some cases it is more beneficial to not vote in order to retain potentially lost points.
